## Persuasive Interfaces for Bias Reduction: Research Context

In today's digital media landscape, recommendation algorithms and social media often reinforce cognitive biases, leading to polarized viewpoints despite users' intellectual acknowledgment of the value of diverse perspectives. Traditional debiasing methods, such as education or fact-checking, frequently face resistance due to confirmation bias and defensive processing. This research addresses the gap between users' desire for balanced information and their actual consumption patterns by exploring subtle, real-time persuasive interface elements (e.g., visual cues, micro-challenges, progress tracking) that encourage diverse viewpoint engagement without triggering defensive reactions. By examining the effectiveness of these mechanisms, their timing, and their impact on defensive processing, the study aims to develop bias-reduction tools that align with natural browsing behaviors, offering a practical approach to mitigating polarization in digital spaces.
